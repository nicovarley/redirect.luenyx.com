# Luenyx Redirect

A simple web redirect service and waiting room for my primary website.

## About This Project

I recently learned that fullstack development is easier than I thought as I built a home server and have been messing with that. So, now I'm making lots of pointless websites! This one is a simple redirector.

## Purpose

The reason I'm making this is that I have a different site built on free Salesforce LWR infrastructure - but the cold boots are like up to one minute ðŸ‘€... That isn't great when I'm providing my CV, so this shall act as a pretty waiting room. I may use it for other purposes later.

Hopefully it serves as a super easy reference/example on how to build an extremely simple site if you're also starting out!
